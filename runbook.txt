PREREQUISITES:

Python 3.8 or higher
nix 
poetry
Docker


To set up the tooling environment (in a local context) and run the data pipelines:

 - clone the repo
 - issue "nix-shell" to install the system dependencies
 - issue 
    "poetry install"

    and then

    "poetry shell" 
    
    to install the Python dependencies and start the virtual environment

 - set the necessary environment vars: 

	PYTHONPATH must include the repository root directory. ( export PYTHONPATH=`pwd` )

Then, at the shell prompt, issue:

 make <pipeline-name>

 where <pipeline-name> is the name of a make target
 
and check the <repo_root>/data directory for the outputs.

(You may need to spin up the local Postgres Docker-container if it is not already running.)

+ Makefile instrumentation: "makeblocks"

The Makefile may contain some comments which contain a particular syntax of the form:

+open-varblock(...)
+open-cmdblock(...)

and so on. These comments are part of the data pipeline testing and instrumentation system. Do not alter or remove them
unless you know what you are doing.
